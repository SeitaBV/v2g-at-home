# FlexMeasures / Home Assistant / Wallbox Quasar integration

This integration lets you add smart charge control to your Wallbox Quasar.
Optimize the upcoming hours with an eye on energy prices, your solar generation or the COâ‚‚ content of the grid.
(For now: only energy prices, the rest is to come.)

In practice, you can do the following via your Home Assistant, you can 

- Switch the charge mode between user and automatic
- In automatic mode, FlexMeasures is periodically asked to generate schedules, which Home Assistant translates into set points which it sends to the Wallbox Quasar via modbus.
- Set targets (e.g. be charged 100% at 7am tomorrow) which prompts FlexMeasures to update its schedules.

This integration is a Python app and uses:

- FlexMeasures for optimizing charging schedules.
- Home Assistant for automating local control over your Wallbox Quasar.
- The AppDaemon plugin for Home Assistant for running the Python app.
- A Modbus specification for communicating with the Wallbox Quasar (currently not publicly available). 

# Installation

The installation tutorial assumes you have already installed Home Assistant, including the AppDaemon 4 add-on.
It also assumes you have a FlexMeasures server set up with a sensor for the Quasar (copy its entity address into the relevant Home Assistant setting), as well as a sensor and data for day-ahead prices.

In Home Assistant, look for the AppDaemon configuration (`Supervisor -> AppDaemon 4 -> Configuration`) and add the following Python packages:

```yaml
python_packages:
  - isodate
  - pyModbusTCP
```

In your Home Assistant file editor, go to `/config/appdaemon/apps/` and add `fm_ha_integration.py`.

In the same directory, add (or extend) `apps.yaml` with (replacing secrets as required for your custom setting):

```yaml

The Wallbox register settings are documented in the Quasar Modbus specification.

In `/config/configuration.yaml` add the following Modbus sensor to get a signal of your car's state of charge, and some input fields to store a clean SoC signal, a selected charge mode and charging schedules:

```yaml

modbus:
  - name: quasar
    delay: 5
    timeout: 4
    type: tcp
    host: !secret wallbox_host
    port: !secret wallbox_port
    sensors:
      - name: charger_connected_car_state_of_charge
        address: !secret wallbox_register_get_state_of_charge
        input_type: holding
        data_type: int16
        scan_interval: 120
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        slave: 1
input_number:
  car_state_of_charge_wh:
    name: Car State of Charge
    icon: mdi:battery-medium
    min: 0
    max: 62000
    step: 1
    unit_of_measurement: Wh
input_select:
  charge_mode:
    name: Charge mode
    icon: mdi:battery-charging-medium
    options:
      - Automatic
      - Forced ON
      - Forced OFF
input_text:
  chargeschedule:
    name: ChargeSchedule
    icon: mdi:calendar-multiselect
```

In `/config/automations.yaml` add:

```yaml
- id: '1626364003549'
  alias: Clean up SoC change as reported by Quasar
  description: "Goal: make the technical state of charge (from Modbus YAML in configuration)\
    \ better readable.\nThe Quasar returns an SoC of 0% if the charger is not connected\
    \ /paused. This is not the true state of charge.\nThis is why we fill another (input)\
    \ variable with the most recent non-zero value.\nThe Modbus YAML code also frequently\
    \ returns \"unavailable\". We also ignore that here.\nTo better estimate the true state\
    \ of charge, we also store the datetime of a (correct) change, as another input number."
