# V2G Liberty: A HomeAssistant-based app to optimize the charging of your EV (using the Wallbox Quasar)

This integration lets you add smart charge control to your Wallbox Quasar. It implements a nice local app in [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) and uses the smart EMS [FlexMeasures](https://flexmeasures.io) for optimized schedules.

The idea is to optimize the upcoming hours with an eye on energy prices, your solar generation or the COâ‚‚ content of the grid
(for now: only European energy prices, the rest is to come).

You can read more about the project and its vision [here](https://positive-design.nl/) and [here](https://seita.nl/project/v2ghome-living-lab/).

In practice, you can do the following via V2G Liberty:

- Switch the charge mode between user and automatic
- In automatic mode, FlexMeasures is periodically asked to generate schedules, which Home Assistant translates into set points which it sends to the Wallbox Quasar via modbus.
- Set targets (e.g. be charged 100% at 7am tomorrow) which prompts FlexMeasures to update its schedules.

This integration is a Python app and uses:

- FlexMeasures for optimizing charging schedules.
- Home Assistant for automating local control over your Wallbox Quasar.
- The AppDaemon plugin for Home Assistant for running the Python app.
- A Modbus specification for communicating with the Wallbox Quasar (currently not publicly available). 

# Installation

The installation tutorial assumes you have already installed Home Assistant, including the AppDaemon 4 add-on.
It also assumes you have a FlexMeasures server set up with a sensor for the Quasar (copy its entity address into the relevant Home Assistant setting), as well as a sensor and data for day-ahead prices.

In Home Assistant, look for the AppDaemon configuration (`Supervisor -> AppDaemon 4 -> Configuration`) and add the following Python packages:

```yaml
python_packages:
  - isodate
  - pyModbusTCP
```

In your Home Assistant file editor, go to `/config/appdaemon/apps/` and add `fm_ha_integration.py`.

In the same directory, add (or extend) `apps.yaml` with (replacing secrets as required for your custom setting):

```yaml

The Wallbox Modbus registers are documented in the Quasar Modbus specification, which is not part of this repository.

In `/config/configuration.yaml` add the following Modbus sensor to get a signal of your car's state of charge, and some input fields to store a clean SoC signal, a selected charge mode and charging schedules:

```yaml

modbus:
  - name: quasar
    delay: 5
    timeout: 4
    type: tcp
    host: !secret wallbox_host
    port: !secret wallbox_port
    sensors:
      - name: charger_connected_car_state_of_charge
        address: !secret wallbox_register_get_state_of_charge
        input_type: holding
        data_type: int16

        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        slave: 1

input_select:

      - Forced OFF
input_text:
  chargeschedule:
    name: ChargeSchedule

```

In `/config/automations.yaml` add:

```yaml

  description: "Goal: make the technical state of charge (from Modbus YAML in configuration)\
    \ better readable.\nThe Quasar returns an SoC of 0% if the charger is not connected\
    \ /paused. This is not the true state of charge.\nThis is why we fill another (input)\
    \ variable with the most recent non-zero value.\nThe Modbus YAML code also frequently\
    \ returns \"unavailable\". We also ignore that here.\nTo better estimate the true state\
    \ of charge, we also store the datetime of a (correct) change, as another input number."
