# Configuration instructions

The content of this folder is part of the V2G Liberty Addon for Home Assistent.
It works together (is dependent on) with AppDaemon code in the AppDaemon `addon_configs` folder.

The files in this folder should be placed in the `config/packages/v2g-liberty` folder. This might need to be created.
